# Topics in Software Engineering - Project Proposal
**Name:** Talike Bennett 

**Project Name:** Binote

**Description:** There are a handful of applications and software available to teach people new languages. For this application, I would like to achieve the same goal but with a musical aspect to it. More specifically, this application will serve as a platform to teach people how to read and play music on a piano. The application can possibly be expanded to have a variety of instruments, but the piano will be the main one in use.

**Primary Users:** This application will be designeâ‚« for people with an interest in music but not much experience with musical instruments. The target audience also includes people who have access to a laptop/desktop machine since I am thinking of implementing the application as a GUI.
